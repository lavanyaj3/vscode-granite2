# Data collection

vscode-granite has opt-in telemetry collection, provided by [vscode-redhat-telemetry](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-redhat-telemetry).

## What's included in the vscode-granite telemetry data

Anonymous data is collected and sent to Red Hat servers to help improve our products and services, including:

 * Model Information from the Setup wizard:
    * Chat model name
    * Tab Completion model name
    * Embeddings model name
  * Error message in case of an error

## What's included in the general telemetry data

Please see the
[vscode-redhat-telemetry data collection information](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-redhat-telemetry/blob/HEAD/USAGE_DATA.md#usage-data-being-collected-by-red-hat-extensions)
for information on what data it collects.

## How to opt in or out

Use the `redhat.telemetry.enabled` setting in order to enable or disable telemetry collection.
Note that this extension abides by Visual Studio Code's telemetry level: if `telemetry.telemetryLevel` is set to off, then no telemetry events will be sent to Red Hat, even if `redhat.telemetry.enabled` is set to true. If `telemetry.telemetryLevel` is set to `error` or `crash`, only events containing an error or errors property will be sent to Red Hat.
